# Towards a Deep and Unified Understanding of Deep Neural Models in NLP

Code implementation of paper *Towards a Deep and Unified Understanding of Deep Neural Models in NLP*

## Environment

In order to use our code, you need to install following softwares/packages:

```
python>=3.5
pytorch-pretrained-bert==0.2.0
torch==0.4.1
matplotlib
numpy
tqdm
```

You may also install jupyter notebook to visit our [torturial](Torturial.ipynb).

## How to use

We provide a small example on how to use our method for explaining the provided $\\Phi$ function on a given $\bf x$ [here](Torturial.ipynb).

## To-do list

- Add an intuitive torturial in readme.md

- Add a torturial on how to visualize one model we have trained.

- Add more documentations to code.
